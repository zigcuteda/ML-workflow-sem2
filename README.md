# ML WORKFLOW SEM2

This repository contains 3 structured Machine Learning projects developed as part of my **Machine Learning Techniques & Algorithms (Semester 2)** coursework.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate hands-on implementation of:

- Data Preprocessing
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Model Evaluation
- Business-oriented ML Presentations

Each project includes:
- Clean Python implementation (Jupyter Notebook)
- Business-focused presentation (PDF format)

# Business-Focused Presentations

For each project, I created a simple and stakeholder-friendly presentation (PDF format) focusing on:

- Problem Statement  
- Approach Used  
- Key Insights  
- Business Impact  
- Final Recommendations  

The presentations are intentionally minimal and text-focused to ensure clarity during live delivery.
